        		<h2>Research</h2>
			<p>My research interests can be summarized into two thematic categories. The first category involves empirical investigations of the criminal legal system. The second category involves developing new methodological tools for spatial data. </p>
			
			
			<h2>Dissertation Project</h2>
			<p>My dissertation project investigates the dynamic relationship between private residents submitting emergency complaints, neighborhood demand for police presence, and jurisdictional policing strategies. Specifically, how can neighborhood demand for police presence bias jurisdictional policing strategies? The term 'bias', as used in this dissertation, involves an increase in the intensity of police presence within a neighborhood, or the number of police-related events per square kilometer. </p>

		 	<p>Even though individual persons submit emergency service calls, responding officers interpret these complaints as (un-) representative features of a neighborhoodâ€™s underlying public safety concerns. In addition, unlike other governmental actors, law enforcement can produce its own bureaucratic output. This means officers can always return to a neighborhood to engage in additional surveiillance and enforcement acts even if residents did not directly request their presence. </p>

			<p>Depending on the jurisiction, this relationship between officer-initiated actions and neighborhood demand for police presence may produce dire consequences, especially in neighborhoods undergoing gentrification; however, the empirical properties of this relationship are poorly understood. In a racially and economically divided society, researchers must take seriously how neighborhood demand for police presence can shape jurisdictional policing strategies. </p>  

			<p>To describe this relationshiip, I introduce a conceptual framework called spillover effects in enforcement. This framework attempts to identify the direct relationship between neighborhood demand for police presence and officer-initiated enforcement or surveillance actions. From here, I develop a set of methodological tools where researchers can convert geoloccated emergency service calls into a continuous measure of neighborhood demand for police presence. Finally, I introduce an inverse weighted research design that attempts to estimate the causal effect of these demands on any type of policing outcome (i.e., vehicular stops, citations, arrests, patrol time, etc.). </p>
